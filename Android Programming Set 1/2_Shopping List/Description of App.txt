Create a shopping list app that allows the user to add and remove items from a shopping list.  
Your app should have an EditText, a ListView and an ADD button. Initially, the list is empty. 
After the user enters an item in the EditText and clicks the ADD button, the new item will be 
added to the bottom of the list.  The user should also be able to remove an item from the list 
by long clicking and holding the item.   (Hint: Use setOnItemLongClickListener method).
