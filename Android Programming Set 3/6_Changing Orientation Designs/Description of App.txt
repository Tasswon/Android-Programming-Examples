Create an app that contains a set of ImageButtons using any images you prefer.
(a) In portrait orientation, when an ImageButton is clicked, the description about the image is shown 
in a new activity. 
(b) In landscape orientation, when an ImageButton is clicked, the image description is shown in a 
fragment in the same activity. The fragment can be added statically or programmatically.
