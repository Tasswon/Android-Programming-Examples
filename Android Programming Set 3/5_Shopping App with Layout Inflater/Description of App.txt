Create a shopping app that shows a list of merchandise items for the user to buy. Each item has an 
image, price and quantity to purchase. When the CheckOut Button is clicked, calculate and show the 
total cost. Generate all the GUI widgets in the Java code instead of the XML layout file.  (You can 
create a layout file for one merchandise item including only an ImageView, a TextView and an EditText 
if you want to use LayoutInflator. However, do not create a layout file that includes all the widgets 
in the user interface.)
