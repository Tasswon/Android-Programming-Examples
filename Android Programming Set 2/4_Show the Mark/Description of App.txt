Create a multiple activity app that students can use to check their midterm exam mark. All the marks 
are stored in a raw text file called exammarks.txt. Each line of the file contains the name, ID, and 
mark of a student. The main activity has two EditTexts, one to enter the student name and the other 
to enter the student ID. After the student enters the name and ID and clicks the SUBMIT Button, the 
activity should check the raw file. If the name and ID are correct, the student’s midterm exam mark 
will be displayed in the second activity. 

If the student name cannot be found in the file, print a Toast message “Student name does not exist”; 
if the student ID is not correct, show a Toast message “Wrong student ID”.  If the student clicks the 
SUBMIT Button without entering a name and/or ID, a Toast message will be displayed to ask the student
to enter the student name/ID.
