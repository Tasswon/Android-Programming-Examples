Create an app with 4 Buttons at the top and 4 TextViews below as shown in the following screen shots. 
In colors.xml, define any 4 colors you like using the RGB model. These four colors will be used as 
background for the Buttons and TextViews.  Whenever a Button is clicked, a counter for that color 
should be increased by one and the value of the counter should be updated in the appropriate TextView.

Implement the onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState methods to retain the activity instance 
state (the color counters) after the screen is rotated. 

Note that the layout of the Buttons and TextViews must be the same as the screen shots, but you can 
define your own 4 colors instead of using red, green, white and blue. To center text in a TextView, 
just set the attribute: android:gravity = "center" for the TextView.
